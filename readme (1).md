## Introduction

The dataset comes from Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree, originally from the kaggle. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings, genres, runtime and revenue. It contains 10866 rows and 21 columns.

I will explore the following questions with respect to this analysis:

- Does runtime of a movie affects its revenue?
- How investment in a movie affects its revenue and profitability?
- Which genres are most popular from year to year?

## Summary and Conclusions

First we analysed how runtime affect the popularity of a movie by plotting a histogram and a scatterplot and the movies that had a runtime of 150-180 minutes had high margin. Then we analysed how genres have an impact on popularity and finally we analysed the sum and mean of total profitability by visualisation and we saw how sum is impacted while average does not. We can conclude that all the three varibles at some point have an impact on the profitability of the movies.
